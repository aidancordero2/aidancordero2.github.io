Algebraic and Diagrammatic Methods for the Rule-Based Modeling of Multiparticle Complexes,"Rebecca J Rousseau, Justin B Kinney",PRX Life 3,2025,https://journals.aps.org/prxlife/abstract/10.1103/PRXLife.3.023004,,"This paper introduces an operator algebra framework that bridges two previously disconnected approaches to modeling multiparticle complexes in stochastic chemical systems: the statistical physics formalism (rooted in Doi's 1976 Fock space approach) and rule-based computational methods developed for simulating biochemical complexes. The new formalism extends Fock space to support not just particle creation and annihilation but also the assembly and disassembly of multiparticle complexes, with rules specified by algebraic operators via Wick's theorem and aided by diagrammatic tools. The result is a unified mathematical and computational framework applicable to both equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems, including a stochastic simulation algorithm for the latter."
Gauge fixing for sequence-function relationships,"Anna Posfai, Juannan Zhou, David M McCandlish, Justin B Kinney","PLoS Computational Biology 21 (3), e1012818",2025,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012818,/pictures/figures/fig1_gaugefixing_posfai_et_al.png,"Quantitative models of sequence-function relationships in computational biology often have ""gauge freedoms"" — parameter degeneracies where values can change without affecting predictions — which must be resolved through ""gauge-fixing"" before model parameters can be meaningfully interpreted. Here, we derive an analytically tractable family of gauges applicable to a broad class of sequence-function models, including additive, pairwise, and higher-order interaction models, unifying many commonly used gauges as special cases. We demonstrate that different gauge choices can be leveraged both to explore complex activity landscapes and to identify simplified, locally valid models, providing practical strategies for interpreting sequence-function relationships."
Interpreting cis-regulatory mechanisms from genomic deep neural networks using surrogate models,"Evan E Seitz, David M McCandlish, Justin B Kinney, Peter K Koo","Nature machine intelligence 6 (6), 701-713",2024,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00851-5,/pictures/figures/fig1_seitz_2024.png,
"Specificity, synergy, and mechanisms of splice-modifying drugs","Yuma Ishigami, Mandy S Wong, Carlos Mart Gómez, Andalus Ayaz, Mahdi Kooshkbaghi, Sonya M Hanson, David M McCandlish, Adrian R Krainer, Justin B Kinney","Nature Communications 15 (1), 1880",2024,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46090-5,/pictures/figures/fig1_ishigami_2024.png,"Here, we introduce mechanistically interpretable quantitative models for how splice-modifying drugs work, combining massively parallel splicing assays, RNA-seq, and dose-response curves to characterize two SMA drugs, risdiplam and branaplam. The results reveal the sequence specificities of both drugs, suggest branaplam operates via two distinct interaction modes at 5' splice sites, and challenge the prevailing two-site hypothesis for risdiplam's activity at SMN2 exon 7. More broadly, the study finds that anomalous cooperativity and multi-drug synergy are widespread among exon-inclusion-promoting drugs, offering both mechanistic clarity on existing treatments and a framework for rational drug development."

Using deep sequencing to characterize the biophysical mechanism of a transcriptional regulatory sequence,"Anna Posfai, Juannan Zhou, David M McCandlish, Justin B Kinney",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 107 (20),2010,https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1004290107,/pictures/figures/fig1_deeplearning_kinney2010.jpg,"This paper presents a method for quantitatively characterizing the protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions that regulate transcription in living cells, using a library of partially mutated regulatory sequences sorted by transcriptional activity and sequenced in bulk. Computational analysis of the resulting data — enabled by a relationship between likelihood and mutual information — can extract precise biophysical parameters even in the presence of experimental noise. Applied to the E. coli lac promoter, the approach successfully identified binding sites, determined sequence-dependent binding energies, and measured in vivo interaction energies between RNA polymerase and transcription factors."
